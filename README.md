# Non-Relativistic Dirac Equation

This script numerically implements the Schrödinger-like equation that can be obtained from the Dirac Equation in its non-relativistic limit by keeping its leading order terms. For more information on the purpose and method of the code, please refer to the main paper:

**in preparation**

# Structure of the Repository

This repository has two files: 

- *README.md*
  
- *Dirac_NonReltivisticLimit.py*: full script used to retrieve the plots in the paper.
