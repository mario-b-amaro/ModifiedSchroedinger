# Non-Relativistic Dirac Equation

This script numerically implements the Schr√∂dinger-like equation that can be obtained from the Dirac Equation in its non-relativistic limit by keeping its leading order terms. 

For more information on the purpose and method of the code, please refer to the main paper:

**in preparation**
